# How does Encapsulation in Python actually work?

Encapsulation is a concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that involves bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data within a single unit, typically a class which hides the implementation details of the programmed elements, while restricting direct access to those elements.

Encapsulation in Python is acheived using:
1. Access modifiers: (public, _protected, _ private)
2. Getters and Setters
3. Data Hiding

Encapsulation helps in data protection, modularity and maintainability of the code.
