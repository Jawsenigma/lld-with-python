# 🧠 Low-Level Design with Python

This repository is a Python-based collection of Low-Level Design (LLD) concepts, design patterns, and real-world design problem solutions.

## 🎯 Objective

To create a structured and exhaustive LLD reference in Python that prepares engineers for LLD interviews and improves object-oriented design thinking.

## 📚 Sections

### 1. Basics
Understand the foundations of OOP in Python including:
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

### 2. Design Patterns
Implementation of core design patterns using idiomatic Python:
- **Creational**: Singleton, Factory, Builder
- **Structural**: Adapter, Decorator, Composite
- **Behavioral**: Strategy, Observer, State

Each pattern includes:
- Code implementation
- UML diagram
- Real-world use case
- Test cases (where applicable)

### 3. LLD Problems
Solutions to common LLD interview questions:
- Parking Lot
- Splitwise
- Elevator System
- Amazon Locker
- Notification System

Each problem includes:
- Requirements and assumptions
- Class diagram
- Code
- Tests
- Design decisions and trade-offs

### 4. System Designs (Optional Extension)
Document-based high-level + low-level designs for scalable services.

## 🛠 Technologies

- Python 3.10+
